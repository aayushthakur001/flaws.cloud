## üßæ Overview

- üîç Mobile App Testing: Assessed and documented 13+ vulnerabilities in the **DIVA Android app** (intentionally insecure).
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security: Solved multiple levels of **flAWS.cloud**, an AWS-based CTF challenge focusing on real-world misconfigurations.

## üì± Project 1: DIVA Android App Assessment

**DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable App)** is designed for Android security training. I analyzed source code, used ADB, and performed black-box testing to uncover security issues.
